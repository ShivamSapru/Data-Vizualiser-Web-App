This is a Data Visualizer Web App that I have created so that the user can easily interact with the datasets through charts and graphs.
I used datasets like diabetes, heart disease prediction, parkinson disease prediction, tips and titanic which are easily available on the Web.
You can select the labels that you want to compare and which graph/plot you want to generate like Line PLot, Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Distribution Plot and many more.
This Streamlit app allows us to visualize and analyze trends.

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/ShivamSapru/Data-Vizualiser-Web-App.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
